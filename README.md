## ðŸ›  Installation & Set Up

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

## ðŸš€ Building and Running for Production

1. Generate a full static production build

   yarn build
   ```

## ðŸ”‘ Environment Variables

To enable GitHub API access in the footer, you must provide a GitHub personal access token with public repo access.

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
2. Add the following line:

   ```sh
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
   ```

Replace `your_github_personal_access_token` with your actual token. You can generate a token at https://github.com/settings/tokens (no scopes required for public data, but 'public_repo' is recommended).

After setting this, restart your development server.
